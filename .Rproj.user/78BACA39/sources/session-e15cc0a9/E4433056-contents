# SeuratExtend_learning

Welcome to my **SeuratExtend_learning** repository! This is my personal learning log and practice environment as I explore and extend functionalities in the Seurat package for single-cell RNA-seq analysis.

## 📘 Purpose

This repository serves three main goals:

1. **Tutorial Practice:** Follow and reproduce official and community tutorials for Seurat and SeuratExtend.
2. **Enhancements & Edits:** Apply my own modifications to the code and methodology for deeper understanding.
3. **Documentation & Tips:** Record notes, insights, and common pitfalls to help reinforce learning and assist others.

## 🧪 What You'll Find Here

- `tutorials/`: Step-by-step walkthroughs from existing guides, with reproducible scripts.
- `my_edits/`: Modified versions of tutorials showcasing experimentation and customization.
- `tips_and_notes.md`: My personal notes, summaries, and tricks learned during exploration.
- `figures/`: Visual outputs generated during analysis.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- R version 4.5.1
- Seurat, SeuratExtend
- tidyverse, ggplot2

## 📁 File Naming Convention

Following best practices:
- Lowercase names with underscores (`_`) for clarity.
- Scripts are prefixed numerically to indicate order of execution (e.g., `1_load_data.Rmd`).
- Each file includes comments explaining **why** steps are performed (not just what).

## 📅 Progress Tracking

I’ll be using commits to track my progress chronologically. Each commit message will briefly summarize the learning outcome or challenge tackled.

## 🤝 Contributions

This is a personal learning project, but suggestions, corrections, or PRs from fellow learners are always welcome!
